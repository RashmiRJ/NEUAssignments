Assignment 3 - Rashmi Rajendra Joshi

Problem statement : Two additional extensions to think about is how to model a ride from a to b and determine
current location of vehicles.

Idea Proposed : 
To model a ride from point A to Point B, we can use the grid system to determine the approximte distance between the points. 
For example point A is (2,4) and point B is (5,4) then the route/distance is v (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 

To select a car for a ride, we can first get the location of the car on the grid, then find the distance of the pickup. 
If distance of Car1 is shorter than Car2 for pickup and if the destination of the ride is in the preferred list of Car1, then choose Car1

If multiple cars are available for the selection, cars can be sorted based on shortest distance to the pickup point.

The above grid implementation gives approximate distance to be travelled in 2D. To achieve accuracy of determining the location of the car and to model the ride from point A to point B, Google Maps API can be used.
